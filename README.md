#### [manual-dispatch.yml](.github/workflows/manual-dispatch.yml)
Manual workflow dispatch with:
- Custom input parameters
- Environment selection
- Dry run capabilities
- Input validation
- Conditional execution

### Security & Quality

#### [security-scan.yml](.github/workflows/security-scan.yml)
Comprehensive security scanning:
- Trivy vulnerability scanning
- CodeQL static analysis
- GitLeaks secret detection
- npm audit security checks
- SARIF result uploads

#### [performance.yml](.github/workflows/performance.yml)
Performance testing automation:

## üìñ Usage

Each workflow file contains detailed comments and examples. To use these templates:

1. Copy the desired workflow file to your repository's `.github/workflows/` directory
2. Modify the configuration to match your project requirements
3. Update secrets and environment variables as needed
4. Customize triggers, branches, and conditions as appropriate

## üîß Configuration

Many workflows require additional configuration:

### Required Secrets
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` & `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (for AWS deployment)
- `S3_BUCKET_NAME` & `CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID` (for AWS deployment)
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK` (for Slack notifications)
- `LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN` (for Lighthouse CI)

### Environment Variables
- Configure environment-specific variables in your repository settings
- Use GitHub Environments for production/staging configurations

## ü§ù Contributing

Feel free to contribute additional workflow examples or improvements to existing ones. Each example should:
- Be well-documented with comments
- Follow GitHub Actions best practices
- Include appropriate error handling
- Use the latest action versions
